=====================

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set, by solving an assignment of a Coursera MOOC called "Getting and Cleaning Data".

In this repo you will find 3 files:

* README.md
* CODEBOOK.md
* run_analysis.R

## Steps:

* Download this file https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* Write in your R console: getwd()
* Unzip the previously downloaded file into that folder
* Download run_analysis.R from this repo and put it into the same folder of the unzipped file
* Write in your R console: source("run_analysis.R")
* Write in your R console: whatever = read.table("super_tidy_data.txt")
* Write in your R console: View(whatever)
