In this repo you will find the `run_analysis.R` script. This R script performs the following transformations on the original data:

## Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

## Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

## Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

## Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 

## Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
